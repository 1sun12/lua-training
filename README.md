# Lua 4 Dummiez

## Book to follow along with:

"Programming in Lua" by Roberto Lerusalimschy

## What is this repo for?

I wanted to follow along with the exercises from this book, and also practice Lua.
That's all this repo is, a collection of programs I wrote to practice.
I am also super into the "CCraft:Tweaked" mod for minecraft, so there's also that.
